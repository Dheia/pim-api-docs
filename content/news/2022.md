# 2022

*You'll find below all the updates that our Serenity Entreprise edition (EE) and Serenity Growth edition (GE) of the PIM have to offer. Enjoy!*

## November 2022

### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> Guided tutorials

We created a ‚ÄúGuided tutorial‚Äù section to list all our new guided tutorials.

## October 2022 

### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> Catalog for Apps

We want to ease App development and configuration, and love to do both simultaneously.

With the Catalogs, you can:
- only retrieve the products you need
- have less code to maintain if you already developed a UI
- don‚Äôt have to master the PIM catalog structure anymore to provide a relevant filtering interface to your users
- and spend less money on configuration UI by using an on-the-shelf solution we provide

And **app users** are more autonomous by configuring their data selection from the Akeneo PIM UI and benefit from a consistent user experience.

## September 2022

### <span class="label label-news label-notice">NOTICE - ADDED</span> Product UUID

A PIM used to contain one and only identification: the so-called field `identifier` (the only `pim_catalog_identifier` attribute of the whole product). In Serenity, this field value is the SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) of the product, but what if you need to identify your product with several product identifiers (SKU, EAN, GTIN,...)? Adding classic fields won't do the job: you need a kind of identifier field for each product. And how will you identify your product if its SKU has changed?

That's the purpose of the brand-new product UUID feature.

But before making it happen, a product must have a **unique** and **immutable** way to identify it: that's why we introduced the product UUID (for Universally Unique Identifier).

## August 2022 

### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> New filters on assets and records 

You can filter assets by requesting **multiple asset codes** and filter records by requesting **multiple Reference Entities Records codes** via our API using the ‚ÄúIN‚Äù parameter.

## July 2022

### <span class="label label-news label-program">BETA</span> Catalog for Apps

We introduce the concept of catalogs to help you better master the Akeneo PIM data in your app. 
As we like to get your feedback, we choose to first deliver a beta version of this feature. If you want to try it, feel free to reach out and give us your feedback.

Stay tuned! We will add features in the PIM interface and in our [Demo App](https://apps.akeneo.com/extension/akeneo-demo-app) all along the summer.

## May 2022

### <span class="label label-news label-updated">UPDATED</span> Connect improvements
We made some improvements to manage connected app authorization updates better. 

Now, if/when your app needs more authorizations, app users don't need to delete the connected app and reconnect it to their PIM. All users who can manage apps will receive a notification to entice them to click on `OPEN APP` and grant the new authorizations requested thanks to the step-by-step activation process. 

We also made some UX improvements to make the app connection experience even smoother.

## March 2022

### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> OAuth 2.0 

You can now connect your app to the Akeneo PIM thanks to the OAuth 2.0 protocol. 

üëâ Learn more about [Authentication and authorization](/apps/authentication-and-authorization.html)


### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> OpenID

You can now connect your app to the Akeneo PIM and get user information using OpenID.

### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> Demo App

To help you understand how Akeneo Apps works, we published the [Akeneo Demo App](https://apps.akeneo.com/extension/akeneo-demo-app) on our [App Store](https://apps.akeneo.com/). You can connect it from any Akeneo PIM and test it. 

üëâ Learn more about [how to implement the OAuth2.0](/apps/authentication-and-authorization.html#getting-started-with-oauth-20) or check our [Akeneo Demo App code on Github](https://github.com/akeneo/demo-app). 


## January 2022

### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> Developer mode and test apps

To help app developers test their app before publishing it on the [Akeneo App Store](https://apps.akeneo.com/), we added a `Developer mode` on all our partner sandboxes. 
With this mode, you can create test apps and get app credentials directly from the PIM.
