# What's next?

*With Akeneo PIM Enterprise Edition and Growth Edition being available as cloud-native SaaS applications, we can regularly deliver new capabilities that address your needs. We are excited to share the features that we are currently working on for our SaaS-based customers.*

## Product data mapping 

You discovered our `catalogs for apps` feature in the [October 2022 section]().  
As we want to give app users the best experience and reduce the development cost for you, app developers, we are working on a mapping interface to avoid you to develop it. 

To do so, in **December 2022**, we will launch an **alpha developer version** of our product data mapping feature. 

You will be able to: 
- access all the endpoints to push a mapping schema for a specific catalog to the PIM
- configure a basic mapping using text attributes of your developer sandbox to test the feature
- use the related endpoints to get the product data in a format that matches your mapping schema properties


Than, **starting from January 2023**, we will make our meta-schema evolve to allow you to ask for multiple types of targets, push your target requirements and information, and ask for required targets. 

From their PIM, app users will configure the mapping to match your app requirements and targets.
